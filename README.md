AIM : Hello World and Calculator program

SOFTWARE USED : VS CODE

Theory:
C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.
One of its essential features is the use of header files such as #include <iostream>,
which allows the program to perform input and output operations.
The cin and cout objects from the iostream library are used for accepting user input and displaying output, respectively.
Every C++ program must include the main() function, which acts as the entry point of execution. Statements in C++ are terminated by a semicolon (;). 
At the end of the main() function, the statement return 0; indicates that the program has executed successfully.
Arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%) are used to perform basic mathematical calculations.
The results of these operations can either be stored in variables for further use or printed directly.
All variables must be declared with appropriate data types, such as int for integers or float for decimal values, before they are used.
C++ is case-sensitive, meaning that identifiers like Sum and sum would be treated as different variables. While comments and indentation do not affect program execution,
they play a crucial role in enhancing readability and maintaining the code.

Algorithm (for Calculator Program):
Start the program.

Declare two integer variables a and b.

Assign or accept values for a and b (e.g., a = 10, b = 5).

Perform the following operations:

sum = a + b

diff = a - b

mul = a * b

div = a / b

Display the results of all operations.

End the program.

Procedure:
Open a C++ IDE or a text editor that supports C++ (such as Code::Blocks, Dev C++, or Visual Studio).

Begin by writing a simple "Hello World" program using the #include <iostream> header file.

Compile and run the program to verify that it displays the expected output on the screen.

Proceed to write a basic calculator program:

Declare variables using suitable data types (int, float, etc.).

Use cin to take two input values from the user.

Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Store the results in separate variables for clarity.

Display the results using cout.

Compile and execute the calculator program to check for correct functionality.

Conclusion:
This experiment served as a foundation for understanding the core elements of C++ programming. By writing and executing simple programs,
such as "Hello World" and a calculator, we gained practical knowledge of basic syntax, variable declaration, data types, and the use of input/output operations.
The use of arithmetic operators for performing calculations demonstrated how C++ can be used for real-time problem-solving. Furthermore, the emphasis on structure, 
case-sensitivity, and readability through proper indentation and comments enhanced our coding practices and logical thinking.
